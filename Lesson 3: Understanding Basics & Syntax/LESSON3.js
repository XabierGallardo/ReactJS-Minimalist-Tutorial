/*All Core React Concepts*/

/*1.	Why a Build Workflow?

- When building a real app, we want to optimize our code and make it faster.
- Also we want to use Next-Gen JS Features (we want to use ES6 and ES5). A build workflow compiles this features
- It's more productive (Next Generation JS Features or CSS Auto prefixing).

	How to?

- Use Dependency Management Tool (npm or yarn). 
Dependencies are 3rd party libraries (3rd party JS packages) like React, ReactDOM, also the Compiler
npm (nodes package manager) is a tool that allows us to manage packages.

- Use Bundler as a Webpack. We use a bundler to write modular code and split it up over multiple files (so each file has a clear task for easier maintenance).

- Use Compiler (Next-Gen JS) which means translation to modern features and working on older browsers.
Also Babel + Presets as part of the webpack configuration to be part of the bundling and optimisation process

- A Development Server to test our app locally on our machine. It wouldn't work if we click and open it onto the browser but it would use file protocol and wouldn't emulate the app running as it runs on a web server.*/




/*2.	Using Create React App

Instructions on
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app 

(requires previous installation of node.js)

npm install -g create-react-app 
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start

Don't quit the process while developing, it will reflect the latest changes*/
