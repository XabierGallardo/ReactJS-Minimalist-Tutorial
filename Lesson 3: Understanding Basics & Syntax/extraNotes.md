Pros and cons of Software Package Managers
https://ehikioya.com/pros-and-cons-of-software-package-managers/


As an example for JavaScript we have npm (NodeJS) and Composer for PHP among many others.
The concept of running one command and having everything created, updated and compiled is great.

Pros:
- Know which library versions you're using
- Additional Features during installation
- Centralized distribution and hosting
- Helping prevent incopatible files from mixing together
- Help discourage gloabl isntallations of dependencies
- Great community behind popular package managers
- Help avoid checking in large binaries
- Standard way of distributing own dependencies
- They document your file version numbers in a centralized place

Cons:
- Overkill, great for large projects, fot for small solutions, require more work and effort than just drop a folder
- Learning curve, library devs can mitigate the problem including installation instructions for bundling (using package manager) and requiring (regular copy paste)
- Herd mentailty, sometimes using a package manager doesn't require to learn what it is actually doing
- Unnecessary Dependency Nightmare, rather than just including a couple of classes.
- Vague error messages
- Extra layer of stuff to troubleshoot
- Don't know where the package comes from
